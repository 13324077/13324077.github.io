[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

简介:

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for **developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms**. It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. You can use it from Python code, and soon from other languages.

OpenAI Gym consists of two parts:

- **The gym open-source library**: a collection of test problems — environments — that you can use to work out your reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments have a shared interface, allowing you to write general algorithms.

- **The OpenAI Gym service**: a site and API allowing people to meaningfully compare performance of their trained agents.
